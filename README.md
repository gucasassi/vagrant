# Vagrant

Vagrant is the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines. 
This repository wants to be a learning guide to introduce yourself to the world of [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs). Specifically, we will learn the following topics:</br></br>

[01 - Getting Started: ](/01-getting-started/README.md) Learn the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines. We will see how to **initialize** a project and create a basic **Vagrantfile**, how to **start**, **stop** and **restart** a virtual machine and how we can connect it using **ssh**.</br></br>

[02 - Synced Folders:](/02-synced-folders/README.md) 
Virtual machines are convenient for development, but not many people want to edit files using a simple terminal-based editor over SSH. In this section we are going to see how to sync files to and from the guest machine with [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs).</br></br>
